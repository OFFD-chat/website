        <h1>About us...</h1>
        <p>
            The Oasis for friendly discussion is a Discord server that was founded to be exactly what it says.
            On discord, and on the internet in general, it can be hard to find a place that has the right balance between allowing controversial topics being discussed while also restricting outright bigotry and hatred.
            This server, with it's dedicated mods and visionary owner, does a better then average job of striking a good balance between these two extremes.
            Please come join us and enjoy controversial debates executed in a respectful manor, enjoy some fun memes, and make new friends along the way.
